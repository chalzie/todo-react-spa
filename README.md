# Instructions

Create a simple and functional To-Do app using React, JavaScript, and a CSS framework of your
choice. Follow these steps to showcase your skills:

1. Begin with creating a public GitHub repository containing a React app written in
   JavaScript. This will provide a platform for collaboration and version control.
2. Select and integrate a preferred CSS framework or component library to give your app a
   visually appealing and responsive design. You can choose from popular CSS frameworks
   such as Bootstrap or Tailwind, or opt for component libraries like MUI or Chakra UI.
3. Develop a To-Do app component with essential functionality, including:
   ● Adding a new task to the list
   ● Removing an existing task from the list
   ● Marking a task as done when completed
   Remember to use components, such as a TaskComponent, and add the To-Do app
   component into the app twice. Both instances should function independently without
   affecting each other.
4. Upgrade your app by refactoring it from JavaScript to TypeScript, offering better
   type-checking and maintainability.
5. Tidy up your code by refactoring the app to briefly follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style
   Guide (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), ensuring a cleaner and more consistent
   codebase.
   After completing each step, make sure to use commits to track your progress; we will be
   reviewing them. For every step in the list, create at least one commit to demonstrate your
   understanding of the version control process.
   If you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of this task, please don't hesitate to
   ask - we can discuss it further. Once the assignment is completed, please provide the link to your
   public GitHub repository.
